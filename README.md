# GocdTray  
GocdTray is a Microsoft Windows System Tray Application for monitoring [Go.cd](https://www.gocd.org/).

The simplest method to install GocdTray is to use the [ClickOnce installation](https://github.com/matroberts/GocdTrayClickOnce).

GocdTray shows a summary status of the go.cd server in the system tray, and provides a detailed status in the dashboard.
